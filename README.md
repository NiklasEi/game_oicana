# Game submission for Mini Jam 71

The game tries to combine the genres `Tower defense`, `Monster tamer` and `Puzzle`. 

## Goal of the game

All enemies are geometrical forms. In the beginning they are all grey, but when getting hit by your towers they get color. When they are beaten, their color fully shows, and they will try to make a run for the trees on the map. During that time you can collect them by clicking on them and use them as puzzle pieces to update your towers or build new ones.

As in every TD game, you can lose by letting too many enemies through to your base.
